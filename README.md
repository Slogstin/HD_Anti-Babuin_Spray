### "BabuBegone" Anti-Babuin Spray

    * Can spawn on Health & Armour bonuses
    * roughly 4% chance of spawning
    * Weighs 8 blocks
    * Works against all enemies, but especially well against Babuins
    * If enemies or friends are burning, it may ignite and make the fire bigger
    * Breaks glass windows
    * Loadout code: ABS
    * Class: HDBabuSpray

    "Don't you hate it when you have a crowd of Babuins sorrounding you, who are just eager to take a bite
    out of your rear? Fear not!
    With BabuBegone, you can show these pesky little flea-dogs that not everything on tastes nice!
    If you spray them long enough, they might even suffocate! Though we may have overdone it with the
    "Pepper" part. This stuff is quite corrosive and is usable against anything with soft, moist tissue.
    It even melts windows! We don't know why, but it does!
    OH! Just be warned that the spray is quite flammable! Any amount of heat on you or your foe may ignite it
    and just add fuel to the literal fire....but maybe that's what you want?"
